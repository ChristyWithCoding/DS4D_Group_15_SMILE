## Our Data Holder
Blackwood Homes & Care, founded in 1972, aims to help people live their lives to the fullest and provides high-quality care services, support, and housing to disabled people of all ages. Blackwood owns over 1500 tenancies across 29 mainland local authorities in Scotland.

## Data
Our alarm data is obtained from the Blackwood Homes & Care. We focus on analyzing current community alarm usage of Blackwood’s customers (disabled people in need of care services and support). The data contains customer’s sex, age, disability, city, home type, alarm type and start time.

## Project Name
Alarm Operator

## Format
Simulated management console game
Our porjetc is a simulated managemet console game that opens to the public.
The game simulates a real day in the life of a Blackwood alarm operator, who processes the alarms and responds to customer’s needs in a time manner.
Our delivered home message is to let people get a sense of the alarm usage of disabled people in Scotland and raise awareness of the needs of people with disabilities.

## About this Github Repository
This repository contains three aspects of the project, one of which is all the environment and scripts for the project game. One part is all the data used in the game, and the other part is all the images used in the game.
