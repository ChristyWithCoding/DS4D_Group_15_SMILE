This is the wireframe of the initial version of the game interface, divided into five sections:
1. Game covers and introductions.
2. Select level page 1, which is divided into three different areas, with the hover state showing the overall alarm data for the area.
3. Select level page 2, where each area is divided into 12 months and the hover state shows the number of different types of alarms for that month.
4. The game page. The alarm operator is required to service the alarm demand that keeps popping up.
5. The game results page, showing game results and further data.
